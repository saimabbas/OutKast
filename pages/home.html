              <h2>The Rise of the Durasha Federation</h2>
              <p>
                Once upon a time, eons ago, the different kingdoms, free cities
                and provinces of the continent were all independent. As
                civilizations grew and prospered, others would crumble and fall,
                and there was a certain harmony in the world. Nation fought
                against nation while maintaining embassies in others and growing
                trade with another but these times have come to an end.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the South an enemy to relative peace stood up, effectively
                disrupting the harmony of the last centuries. They called
                themselves the Durasha Federation and were a loosely arranged
                group of states united under one banner with at the head the
                Emperor. Each nation was allowed their own form of government
                but were restricted in their policies by those of the Empire.
              </p>
              <p>
                The taxes they had to pay and the soldiers they had to provide
                to the massive army of the Durasha Federation kept the
                possibility for revolts very low as well. And thus, government
                after government, nation after nation toppled over and their
                heads were replaced by loyalists to the Empire. It only felt
                like a matter of time before the whole continent would bend
                their knee to their overlord, the Emperor.

              <p>
                The Durasha federation took a double stance on their conquered
                territories. Everyone was free to move and migrate within the
                Empire but there was an effective classicist element within the
                Durasha Federation. The native races of Durasha, the blue
                skinned water dragon race, the Naga, and the red skinned fire
                dragon race, the Aidan, were by law above all other citizens.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other ethnicities were banned from climbing up the ranks of the
                military to the highest ranks, property disputes were always
                settled in favor of the Naga and the Aidan and even members of
                the two races who were taking part of interracial relations were
                shunned by their own community. This has become a problem in the
                last decades, with the Naga and Aidan effectively hunting down
                half bloods to keep the blood of their people pure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Officially however, the Durasha Federation stated their position
                as one of self-dependency, giving conquered nations their own
                rights to uphold the law in their own territory. Kings who
                willingly bend the knee were reinstated after the conquest,
                others who put up a fight were replaced by a more willing family
                member or other noble family.

              <h2>The Regions of the Durasha Federation</h2>
              <p>
                Once upon a time, eons ago, the different kingdoms, free cities
                and provinces of the continent were all independent. As
                civilizations grew and prospered, others would crumble and fall,
                and there was a certain harmony in the world. Nation fought
                against nation while maintaining embassies in others and growing
                trade with another but these times have come to an end.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the conquests of the Durasha Federation raged on, there was
                no one official map to the Durasha Federation because of the
                ever-changing nature of the regions. There are however a few key
                regions that can be described.
              </p>
              <h6>Durashi: home of the Naga and the Aidan</h6>
              <p>
                The native lands of the Naga and the Aidan, a rugged land split
                through by an inhospitable mountain range. It is widely believed
                that both of them come from one and the same race but at some
                point in their evolution they were split up. The Naga in their
                homeland were mostly confined to the cliffs on the coast,
                carving out entire cities in it while the Aidan built their
                settlements right in the small crevasses and canyons of the
                mountains. Over time, the Naga due to their diet of mostly
                seafood got softer, almost like fish-scaled skin while the Aidan
                became more rugged and brownish red. Now this region is a more
                traditionally and ceremonially used place, with no real cities
                or population.

              <h2>The Homelands: Land of the metropole</h2>
              <p>
                What the Naga and the Aidan refer to as their Homelands is in
                fact their first jointly conquered territories, the lands that
                were inhabited by the now extinct people, the Sha’hal. The lands
                were lush, filled with jungles and hills filled with useful
                mining resources and so became an ideal target for their
                expansion. their armies united and overwhelmed the natives,
                effectively killing all of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                In hindsight they regretted their slaughter and instituted the
                idea of self-dependency if they ever conquered another
                territory. As they now had more land to rule over, the Durasha
                Federation was installed, with a council of equal amount Aidan &
                Naga, with an Emperor presiding the Council of the Dragon. They
                realised they needed more labour forces to work the mining
                operations they needed, the forestry for their construction and
                in general servants to live like kings themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                The regions closest to them fell victim to their expansion drift
                and became part of what is now known as the Homelands. In the
                shadow of the old mountains, there has been a city constructed
                that has no equal in the world. The Capital of the Homelands and
                the Durasha Federation in general,is always building up,
                attracting more people, Naga, Aidan and others alike. It became
                known as Mogla Durash.
